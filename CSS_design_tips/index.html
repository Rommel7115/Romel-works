    <div class="tip" id="tip1">
        <h2>01. Keep Your Homepage Minimalistic</h2>
        <p>Your website’s homepage should communicate your core message instantaneously. After all, we rarely read every word on a website. Instead, we quickly scan the page, picking out key words, sentences and images. With these known behaviors in mind, it’s better to appeal to emotions rather than word count.

    <!-- Tip 2 -->
    <div class="tip" id="tip2">
        <h2>02. Design with Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Hierarchy is an important principle of design that helps display your content in a clear and effective manner. Through the correct use of hierarchy, you’ll be able to lead site visitors’ attention to certain page elements in order of priority, starting with the most significant piece.</p>
        <div class="navigation">
            <a href="#tip1" class="button">Back</a>
            <a href="#tip3" class="button">Next</a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Tip 3 -->
    <div class="tip" id="tip3">
        <h2>03. Create Easy-to-Read Content</h2>
        <p>“Readability” measures how easy it is for people to recognize words, sentences, and phrases. When your site’s readability is high, users will be able to effortlessly scan, or skim-read, through it. This way, taking in the information becomes effortless.</p>
        <div class="navigation">
            <a href="#tip2" class="button">Back</a>
            <a href="#tip4" class="button">Next</a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Tip 4 -->
    <div class="tip" id="tip4">
        <h2>04. Ensure Easy Navigation</h2>
        <p>It may be in your nature to break the mold, but website navigation is not the place to be avant-garde. After all, you want your users to easily find what they’re looking for. In addition, a site with solid navigation helps search engines index your content while greatly improving the user experience.</p>
        <div class="navigation">
            <a href="#tip3" class="button">Back</a>

    <!-- Tip 5 -->
    <div class="tip" id="tip5">
        <h2>05. Stay Mobile Friendly</h2>
        <p>All of your site visitors should be able to enjoy your professional website at its very best, no matter the device they’re browsing. When designing a website, Wix automatically creates a mobile-friendly version of your site, so that you can keep pace with the increasingly mobile world.</p>
